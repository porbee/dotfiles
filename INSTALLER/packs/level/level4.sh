# This is level <4> of the package installer, it executes this shell script and
# installs the packages listed below, the packages can be from the AUR or the
# normal package manager tha comes with the system.
#
# The levels indicate the complexity of the installation. Level one being the 
# basic needs of a system. And level 5 representing the level that has less 
# usefulness, making the installation more complex and tedious to configure.
#
# Levels <1> and <2> are the basic ones, needed on almost all installations.
#
# Levels <3> and <4> are the quality-of-life levels, may not be of big use 
# but it saves a lot of time in the long run.
#
# Level <5> is for having the complete installation, it is the least fundamental
# because a system can run perfect and smoothly without level <5> installed.
